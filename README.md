## Overview

This role install and configure the ensemble of tools for ISPConfig system. But it does a little more than that :

- Install jailkit through repository
- Install certbot through backports repository
- Security enforcement (see below)
- Postfix tuning
- Apache2 tuning
- MySQL tuning

After deploying the entire role : `cd /tmp/ispconfig3_install/install && php -q install.php`
Once everything is installed, generate a let's encrypt certificate for your `hostname_fqdn variable`.
You can get the `mysql_root_password` if automatically generated in `/root/.my.cnf`
Then start the role again with `ispconfig_ssl` tag to use the let's encrypt certificate.

If you want to update your ispconfig installation, run `php -q update.php` instead of `php -q install.php`.

Security Enforcement :
- /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
- /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/roundcube.conf
- /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/phpmyadmin.conf
- /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf

- Access Roundcube interface : `https://<hostname_fqdn>/webmail`
- Access PhpMyAdmin interface : `https://<hostname_fqdn>/databases` (every scriptkiddy is looking for /phpmyadmin or something close).

There is also an iptables sample with required firewall rules for make everything works fine, with a few security rules in bonus. Check the `recommanded-firewall.md` file.

## Disclaimer

This role is hudge, it install a lot of stuff (and it does not install clamav by the way), and although I managed to make dozens of tests, I may have missed some issues, so feel free to contact me or to help me out improving this role.

## Requirement

- Ansible 2.5
- OS : Debian Stretch

## Minimal Quickstart

Install the role, then :

```
---
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - ispconfig
  vars:
    hostname_fqdn: 'foo.org'
```

## Configuring the role

There is a lot of variables (list) used to manage packages and other stuff, feel free to take a look in `defaults/main.yml` and to surcharge vars if needed.

The install process is quite clear and commented, all tasks have explicit name, you won't be lost if you want to understand how the whole stuff works.

For a full installation, you will want to set every `install_xxx` variables to true. But you may not want to install everything.
